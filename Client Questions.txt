Questions to ask Bob on Wednesday afternoon:

1. We're looking at creating a web interface in php for customers to buy train
tickets. How far should we go in terms of implementing a secure site? 
	-Should we require a user to log in, have visibility determined by account settings, etc.

2. Should we focus on just a passenger or freight type of train? Is looking at both types too broad?

3. Should we not add the track relations (Track, Train Route), These seem like complicated relations.

4. What if a train has multiple engines (double-heading, push-pull trains)? Can we ignore this possibility?

5. Can we assume traincars can't be left at stations along the way?

6. Both Staff on Board and Train Schedule relations require all attributes to form a key, is this alright?

7. What is the next step after creating a relational diagram for our database?
	-what exactly do we need to do in XAMPP?
	
8. Is is bad to give a lot of relations an ID attribute?

Note: they do have a foreign key.
