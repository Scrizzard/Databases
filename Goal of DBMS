  The goals of our train DBMS is to track all freight and passengers trains operating on a set of tracks. 
The DBMS would allow tickets to be booked by a passenger for a voyage. The voyage would have specific attributes
which represent the rout the train will take and what element are involved in achieving the specified voyage. 
In addition to passenger cars our DBMS will have freight cars which transport cargo, and have specific pick up and 
drop off destinations.  A keystone to DBMS will be the Engine ID associated with a specific engine, as most attributes i
n the DMBS can only relate to a single engine at one time.
