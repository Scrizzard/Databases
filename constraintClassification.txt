Tickets are issued for future voyages-CKECK, or assertion 

Values are positive-I think we have to do this with a CKECK

Passenger cars are not oversold-CHECK

One seat per individual per voyage-TRIGGER..on insert look for passenger with same id on that voyage 

The baggage cars can fit all passengers' baggage- TRIGGER. add new bggage cars by checking how many passengers cars on a voyage and how many passengers in those cars 

The dining cars can feed all passengers-ASSERTION

Each voyage has one engine-TRIGGER...when inseting into voyage

The engine can pull all the cars-TRIGGER...on adding a car to a voyage

Engines types are invented in the past-CHECK

Voyages arrive after they depart-use a CHEECK

Trains do not collide at their outset-TRIGGER...when adding new voyages

All active trains and cars are in service-CHECK

Routes have at least one stop-ASSERTION

Routes are continuous- this whould be the last one we implement i thing it seems like it would be a tricky trigger 

Engines and cars may not be on multiple simultaneous voyages-
