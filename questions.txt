Questions to ask Bob on Friday afternoon:

1. We're looking at creating a web interface in php for customers to buy train
tickets. How far should we go in terms of implementing a secure site? ie. so
that different customers can't look at each others booking information

2. Should we focus on just a passenger or freight type of train? Is looking at both types to broad?

3. Should we not add the track relations (Track, Train Rout), The seem like complicated relations. 

4. What if a train requires multiple engines? Can we ignore this real life application of trains?

5. Can we assume cars can't be left at stations along the way?

6. Both Staff on Boar and Train Schedual relations require all atributes to form a key, is this alright? 
Note: they do have a foreign key.
